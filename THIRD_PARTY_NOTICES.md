# Third-Party Notices

Directory Opus 5 is released under the AROS Public License version 1.1; see
`COPYING`. Optional build configurations may include or link third-party
components under their own licenses. Binary distributors should include this
file, or equivalent notices, with releases that enable those components.

## FTP SFTP Support

When the FTP module is built with `sftp=yes`, SFTP support is implemented with
libssh2. The Amiga cross-build helper under `source/Modules/ftp/third_party`
fetches libssh2 1.11.1 by default and builds it as a static library. The SFTP
build also links zlib from the target toolchain. libssh2 may use the target
SSL/crypto implementation configured for that build, for example AmiSSL/OpenSSL
on Amiga targets; those components remain under their own licenses and notices.

## libssh2

Default version fetched by the Amiga cross-build helper: 1.11.1.

## zlib

The sacredbanana Amiga cross-build image currently provides zlib 1.3.1.1-motley
for the m68k-amigaos target. Other target toolchains may provide a different
compatible zlib build.
